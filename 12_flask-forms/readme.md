K12 -- flask forms  
2022-10-17  
time spent: 1 hrs  


notes:
- We had to combine the / and /auth routes to get POST method to work.
- When submitting form data with POST, it's no longer visible in the address bar, so we can't change it after we submit
- When submitting form with request.form, the form data is accessed on the web server with request.form instead of request.args
