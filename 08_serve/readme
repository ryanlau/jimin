New Deal: Fang Min Chen, Ryan Lau, Anson Wong

plan:
 - choose a random occupation algo from teammates k06
 - add the algo into file 
 - return fstring with roster, random occupation, and list of occupations
 - make it look nice

discos & notes:
 - whatever gets returned is what shows up in the browser
 - random.choices(occupations, weights) is an optimized way of choosing random weighted choices
 - list(dict.keys()) is same as list(dict). maybe?
 - <br> = \n in html
 - <ul>
    <li>thing</li>
    <li>thing</li>
    <li>thing</li>
    <li>thing</li>
   </ul> = bulleted list in html
 - <strong>thing</strong> = bold in html
 - whatever is in the fxn gets rerun if browser is refreshed
 - app.run() is important!
