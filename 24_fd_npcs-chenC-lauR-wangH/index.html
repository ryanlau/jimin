                    <h4>Relationship history</h4>
                    <p>&lt;T&gt; was adopted by Ryan's parents sometime in the early 2010s from the American Museum of Natural History. Shortly after, &lt;T&gt; was gifted to Ryan. It has never left Ryan's room since, except for when he moved and when he brought him to Ducky Sharing Day.</p>
                    <h4>Current standing</h4>
                    <p>&lt;T&gt; no longer glows in the dark. He is currently proudly standing on top of multiple cardboard boxes.</p>
