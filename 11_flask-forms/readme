Predictions:

What does @app.route("/", methods=['GET', 'POST']) do?
Defaults to allow "getting"--access contents--and "posting"--uploading data

If we run localhost/, renders login.html only if methods include 'GET'

Disco:

127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=NewDeal&sub1=Submit
After form submission, Flask sends a get request, and
runs authenticate() from app.py, which returns a string.
Browser updates the page to the new route.

Methods not allowed for requested URL when methods=['POST']
